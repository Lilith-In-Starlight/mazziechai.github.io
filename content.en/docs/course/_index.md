# Introduction to Toaq

## What is Toaq?

Toaq is a *loglang*, part of the broader conlang category.
Loglangs are broadly classified by a specific trait of the language: its *unambiguous* parsing of grammar.
A quite popular loglang is Lojban. However, Toaq deviates from the Lojbanic style in its foundational goals;
Toaq is based on *predicate logic*, a mathematical concept.

Toaq is a tonal language, meaning the pitch of your voice dictates the meaning of the word.
In most natural languages with tones, tones are lexical, meaning they change the definition of the word entirely.
Toaq is different in this regard as tones are *syntactical* as well as lexical instead, syntactic meaning tones change the grammatical function of the word. 

The following is an example of a Toaq sentence:

> {{% toaq %}}Lıecho chuq káto báq cıe.{{% /toaq %}}
>
> {{% derani %}}󱚼󱚹󱛍󱚴󱚿󱛃 󱚿󱚲󱛂 󱛘󱛄󱛊󱚺󱚷󱛃󱛙 󱛘󱚲󱛊󱚺󱛂󱛙 󱚹󱚹󱛍󱚴 󱛕{{% /derani %}}
>
> The cat likes to eat fish.

## What is predicate logic, and what does it serve in the context of Toaq?

[Predicate logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic) is a fancy math thing that basically combines logic, variables, and *predicates*, using special words like "for all x, there exists some y where z" with a special notation to go with it.
It's really confusing to me and I hate it, and it's not essential to know it to be able to speak Toaq (although it helps to know some).

Predicate logic lays the foundation of how the language functions as a whole, as part of its [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics).
Because of this, there are certain particles and grammatical structures that make sense in the context of predicate logic, such as <css style="color:Violet;">lä</css>, the lambda clause particle.

I promise that Toaq isn't close to being as complicated as Wikipedia article on predicate logic. It is a fun and rewarding language to speak with a cute gay community as a bonus.
